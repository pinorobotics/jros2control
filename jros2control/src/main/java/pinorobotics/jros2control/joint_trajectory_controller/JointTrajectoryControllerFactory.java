     * Joint Trajectory Controller
     *
     * <p>Every time {@link JointTrajectorySubscriber} receives new trajectory from ROS nodes, it
     * process all the states through which joints must travel to execute such trajectory. Each of
     * these states are sent to {@link ActuatorHardware} in same order as they present in the
     * trajectory.
     *
     * <p>There are two mechanisms for sending trajectories to the controller:
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li>via action, see actions
     *   <li>via topic, see subscriber
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>Difference between this controller and ROS2 standard joint_trajectory_controller:
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li>No interpolation of waypoints in time
     *   <li>Supports only positions (velocities, accelerations, efforts are ignored)
     * </ul>
     *

     * @param jointStateListeners list of user defined joint listeners which will be notified for
     *     any received joint trajectories
     * @param joints list of joints which states will be published. It can be taken from
     *     ros2_controllers.yaml which is usually generated by MoveIt Setup Assistant
     * @param initialPositions joint initial positions. It can be taken from initial_positions.yaml
     *     which is usually generated by MoveIt Setup Assistant
     * @param controllerName controller name matches the topic name from which this controller will
     *     receive trajectories
